long search for the one and only master on the long-suffering site www.cielparfum.com which was assembled by an extremely incompetent programmer and once a month stably threatened to die, led me to the site and, as a result, to the guys from Drupal-coder. And for almost six months now, not a day has passed that I haven't been surprised and pleased with my luck! Fixed everything that didn't work - from the search to the menu display. We carried out a redesign - without departing from the desired, but with its own significant and high-quality additions. We have implemented a number of projects - contests, tests, etc. And there are countless minor repairs and improvements! And most importantly - everything is high-quality and fast (despite not the \"fastest\" tariff). There are questions - the wonderful Alexey will always prompt, support, repair and / or just make from scratch. There is an idea for implementation - the wonderful Sergey will discuss and offer the ideal option. There is a problem - wonderful Nadezhda and Roman will fix, correct, do! The guys proved that this CMS is a powerful and competent management system. I hope that our cooperation will last for a long time!
